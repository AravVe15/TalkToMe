# Lessons Learned & Operational Notes

This document captures operational gotchas, environment quirks, and technical insights discovered during project setup and development.

## 1. Antigravity CLI Custom Agents & Model Tiers

- **Model Tier Frontmatter Constraint**: The YAML frontmatter for custom agents in Antigravity strictly validates the `model` field against tier enums: `inherit`, `pro`, `flash`, `flash_lite`.
- **Silent Load Failure**: Supplying a specific model name (e.g., `gemini-3.8-flash-high` or `claude-sonnet-5-5-high`) directly in the `model:` frontmatter key triggers a schema mismatch that **silently drops the agent file during discovery**. Custom agents must specify `model: inherit` and receive specific models via CLI flag invocation: `agy --agent <name> --model <model-id>`.

## 2. Windows Environment & Cross-Platform Verification

- **Cross-Platform Scripts**: Do not rely on platform-specific scripts (`.ps1` or `.sh`) for primary development workflows. Standardizing on `npm` scripts in `package.json` guarantees cross-platform compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux developer environments.

## 3. Realtime Audio & Browser Autoplay Nuances (To Monitor)

- Modern mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome) enforce strict autoplay policies on WebRTC remote audio streams. Remote audio elements must be attached and played in direct response to user gesture ("Start Voice Chat").
